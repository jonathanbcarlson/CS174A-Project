# CS174A-Project

For our Computer Graphics (CS 174A) project, we were inspired by the 2022 World Cup.

So we created [Penalty Shootout](https://www.jonathanbcarlson.com/CS174A-Project/), a game where you shoot penalties against your friends, an AI, or to gain practice.

Watch a [presentation](https://youtu.be/YagnUFtaj8A) explaining how we made it.
